# My Interests
Yes, I am a real person outside of research and studying. Here are some of the things I like to do (this is me nonchalantly asking to get invited on lab camping or hiking trips :P)

## Outdoors
I love being outdoors. Hiking on the west coast. Can't count the number of times I have been to Vancouver.

## Travelling
I enjoy exploring new places.  

### China, Egypt, Northern Canada
I have visited multiple cities and loved the culture, food, and scenery.

## Modelling
I also do some modelling here and there.
