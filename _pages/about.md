Hi, I'm Mithun Vanniasinghe. I am an undergraduate student in the [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/program/what-is-engsci/) program at the University of Toronto majoring in Machine Intelligence and minoring in Robotics. 

I am currently in my **final year** of undergraduate studies, focusing on all things **reinforcement learning (RL), control theory, and robotics**.  For my undergraduate thesis, I’m exploring how to integrate **representation learning** with **Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis**, supervised by [Nick Rhinehart](https://leaf.utias.utoronto.ca/). I also spend time as a **Teaching Assistant** for first-year **Linear Algebra** (I love teaching — and linear algebra :D).


This past summer, I was co-supervised by [Nick Rhinehart](https://leaf.utias.utoronto.ca/) and [Tim Barfoot](http://asrl.utias.utoronto.ca/~tdb/) on a project involving **imitation learning for human-robot social navigation**.  It was my first project working with real hardware and performing real “in-the-wild” experiments. I learned an incredible amount — and even got a paper out of it!

I completed my **Professional Experience Year (PEY) Co-op** at [Tenstorrent](https://tenstorrent.com/), where I worked as an **Applied Machine Learning Engineer** focusing on **optimizing LLMs** and analyzing their **performance on Tenstorrent hardware**.  

At the same time, I was an **undergraduate ML researcher** at the [Dynamic Optimization and Reinforcement Learning Lab](https://cglee.mie.utoronto.ca/research-lab/) at UofT, supervised by [Chi-Guhn Lee](https://cglee.mie.utoronto.ca/).  During this time, I also initiated a **collaborative project** with [Jiayu Chen](https://agentic-intelligence-lab.org/members/jiayu-chen.html) at **Hong Kong University**, working on **interpretable hierarchical imitation learning**.

Previously, I worked as a researcher at the [Super Cryogenic Dark Matter Search](https://supercdms.slac.stanford.edu/) (**SuperCDMS**) international collaboration, developing **machine learning techniques and tools** for experimental setups at the **University of British Columbia**.

## Research Interests {#research-interests}

I am passionate about exploring various areas in technology and science. My primary research interests include:

- **Reinforcement Learning**
- **Optimal and Safe Control**
- **Imitation Learning**
- **Robotics**

I am particularly interested in how these fields intersect to create safer autonomous systems. I am interested in the theoreitcal foundations of buidling safe, autonmous systems, and especially currently interested in the field of reachability analysis.

## Teaching {#teaching}

I had the privlege of being a teaching assitant for first year engineering linear algebra and calculus II. In addition to research, I love helping others learn (especailly linear algebra, can you tell I like linear algebra yet lol)

1. [MAT188 - Linear Algebra](https://engineering.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/mat188h1)
   
   2x taught 

2. [MAT187 - Calculus II](https://engineering.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/mat187h1)
