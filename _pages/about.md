Hi, I'm Mithun Vanniasinghe. I am an undergraduate student in the [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/program/what-is-engsci/) program at the University of Toronto majoring in Machine Intelligence and minoring in Robotics. 

I am currently in my **final year** of undergraduate studies, focusing on all things **reinforcement learning (RL), control theory, and robotics**.  For my undergraduate thesis, I’m exploring how to integrate **representation learning** with **Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis**, supervised by [Nick Rhinehart](https://leaf.utias.utoronto.ca/). I also spend time as a **Teaching Assistant** for first-year **Linear Algebra** (I love teaching — and linear algebra :D).


This past summer, I was co-supervised by [Nick Rhinehart](https://leaf.utias.utoronto.ca/) and [Tim Barfoot](http://asrl.utias.utoronto.ca/~tdb/) on a project involving **imitation learning for human-robot social navigation**.  It was my first project working with real hardware and performing real “in-the-wild” experiments. I learned an incredible amount — and even got a paper out of it!

I completed my **Professional Experience Year (PEY) Co-op** at [Tenstorrent](https://tenstorrent.com/), where I worked as an **Applied Machine Learning Engineer** focusing on **optimizing LLMs** and analyzing their **performance on Tenstorrent hardware**.  

At the same time, I was an **undergraduate ML researcher** at the [Dynamic Optimization and Reinforcement Learning Lab](https://cglee.mie.utoronto.ca/research-lab/) at UofT, supervised by [Chi-Guhn Lee](https://cglee.mie.utoronto.ca/).  During this time, I also initiated a **collaborative project** with [Jiayu Chen](https://agentic-intelligence-lab.org/members/jiayu-chen.html) at **Hong Kong University**, working on **interpretable hierarchical imitation learning**.

Previously, I worked as a researcher at the [Super Cryogenic Dark Matter Search](https://supercdms.slac.stanford.edu/) (**SuperCDMS**) international collaboration, developing **machine learning techniques and tools** for experimental setups at the **University of British Columbia**.

  *Bachelor of Applied Science (BASc), [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/program/what-is-engsci/)*  
  *Major: [Machine Intelligence](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/program/majors/machine-intelligence/) · Minor: [Robotics] (https://undergrad.engineering.utoronto.ca/academics-registration/engineering-minors-certificates/robotics-mechatronics-minor/) *  


## Research Interests {#research-interests}

I am passionate about exploring various areas in technology and science. My primary research interests include:

- **Reinforcement Learning**
- **Optimal and Safe Control**
- **Imitation Learning**
- **Robotics**

I am particularly interested in how these fields intersect to create safer autonomous systems. I am interested in the theoreitcal foundations of buidling safe, autonmous systems, and especially currently interested in the field of reachability analysis. 


## Publications {#publications}

Here are my current publications that are in progress:

1. **[Ratatouille: Offline Imitation Learning for Real-World Social Robot Navigations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.17204)**  
   *Status*: Second author, submitted to ICRA 2026  

   J. R. Han, M. Vanniasinghe, H. Sahak, N. Rhinehart, and T. D. Barfoot, “Ratatouille: Imitation Learning Ingredients for Real-world Social Robot Navigation,” arXiv preprint arXiv:2509.17204, 2025. [Video Demo]


2. **Offline Discovery of Interpretable Skills from Multi-Task Trajectories**  
   *Status*: Co-first author, submitted to ICRA 2026  

   C. Zhu, M. Vanniasinghe, J. Chen, and C.-G. Lee, “Offline Discovery of Interpretable Skills from Multi-Task Trajectories,” manuscript submitted for publication,, 2025.

3. **Rapid Creation of Synthetic Data for Analysis of Dark Matter Data with Generative Adversarial Networks**  
   *Status*: In Progress (for submission to NIMA early 2025)  

   *Description*: Explores the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to quickly generate salt (fake data) for dark matter analyses. One of the primary challenges of salting in experiments like SuperCDMS is the time-consuming nature of generating sufficient salt. The research presented aims to overcome this limitation and optimize the salting process.
