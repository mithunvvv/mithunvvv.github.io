I am an undergraduate student in the [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/program/what-is-engsci/) program at the University of Toronto majoring in Machine Intelligence and minoring in Robotics. 

I am currently on my Professional Experience Year (PEY) Co-Op at [Tenstorrent](https://tenstorrent.com/) where I work as an Applied Machine Learning Engineer focusing on focusing on optimizing LLMs as well as analyzing their performance on Tenstorrent hardware. I am also currently an undergraduate ML researcher at the [Dynamic Optimization and Reinforcement Learning Lab](https://cglee.mie.utoronto.ca/research-lab/) at UofT. I am also a researcher at the [Super Cyrogenic Dark Matter Search](https://supercdms.slac.stanford.edu/) (SuperCDMS) international collaboration and experiement where I am doing work as a machine learning researcher for experimental techniques. 

## Research Interests {#research-interests}

I am deeply passionate about exploring various areas in technology and science. My primary research interests include:

- **Reinforcement Learning**
- **Optimal and Safe Control**
- **Imitation Learning**
- **Optimization**

I am particularly interested in how these fields intersect to create smarter and more autonomous systems.

## Publications {#publications}

Here are my current publications that are in progress:

1. **Interpretable Option-based Adversarial Hierarchical Imitation Learning**  
   *Status*: In Progress (for submission to IROS 2025) 

   *Description*: Developing a novel learning algorithm using adverarial hierarchical imitation learning for robotic control with emphasis on learning interpretable agent policies in long horizon tasks.

2. **Rapid Creation of Synthetic Data for Analysis of Dark Matter Data with Generative Adversarial Networks**  
   *Status*: In Progress (for submission to NIMA early 2025) 

   *Description*: Explores the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to quickly generate salt for dark matter analyses, a method that could significantly speed up the process. One of the primary challenges of salting in experiments like SuperCDMS is the time-consuming nature of generating sufficient salt. The research presented aims to overcome this limitation and optimize the salting process.
